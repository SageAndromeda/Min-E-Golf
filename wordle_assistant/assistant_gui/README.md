I'm gonna be straight here, I wrote all of this before realising that stuff had been committed to the github. So all of my logic is super funky, but to my testing it does work remarkably well.

I took a list of words that are valid in wordle from an online source, so it may be incomplete. Might need to scrape for every valid 5 letter word.

One thing to note, it becomes much more capable, if it ommits results with misplaced characters in the same position. Logic is needed.

The GUI setup also needs work, I kind of just put everything in its place, it resulted in many lines which are close enough that a loop could make them.

I really didn't want to come in with a complete script, and disregard your guys' work, so if we can consolidate everything that works, that would be fantastic.

^sry for rant
